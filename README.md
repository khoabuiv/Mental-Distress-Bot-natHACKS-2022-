# Mental-Distress-Bot-natHACKS-2022-

Due to the grassroot nature of online network platforms on Discord and Reddit, moderators often face with the problems on how to efficiently moderate, and deliver the help to members who need support. In this project, we are developing a bot to help moderators and other online volunteers identify distress community members, provide them with the resources they needed, and send warning to the at risk members.

Todo list:
- Find dataset to work with.
- Using APIs to find and grab social media content and run analysis.
- Using these metrics to identify people who need help.
- Differentiate the people who need help from trolls. 

Team members:
- Michael Williams
- Gavin Rozario
